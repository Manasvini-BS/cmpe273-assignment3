For PUT/request :

I have not hard coded Auth_token in the code.
Please specify your auth_token in the request header while making put request.
Format : Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>

For httprouter package :

I have downloaded httprouter folder from github and kept it in the same directory where my .go files are running. so I have changed import path for the httprouter to relative path of the folder. To successfully execute the go files , we have to keep httprouter folder inside same folder where .go files are kept.
